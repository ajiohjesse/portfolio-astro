    I'm Jesse Ajioh, a Fullstack Web Developer with proficiency in modern tools
    and frameworks, and a passion for building scalable web applications that
    solve real-world problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've always been interested in the internet and have been playing around
    with static site builders and tools like Blogger and WordPress since 2014.
    However, my journey as a professional web developer began in early 2021 when
    I started learning the JavaScript programming language.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then, I've become proficient in both JavaScript and TypeScript, and
    have built and deployed a variety of web applications using React and
    Next.js. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work remotely for two
    tech companies, contributing to projects across different domains. I'm also
    currently in the process of launching my own startup â€” a venture that's been
    both challenging and incredibly exciting.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to development, I'm certified in both Project Management and
    Human Resource Management. I often take on roles involving project
    coordination and product design, combining technical expertise with
    strategic planning to deliver well-rounded solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also do freelance work, helping clients bring their ideas to life with
    clean, responsive, and performant web applications.
